### Exceptions ###
   - In java we have three types of exceptions
     1. Checked Exceptions : The exceptions which are checked by compiler at compile time.
     2. Unchecked Exceptions : The exceptions which are not checked by compiler at compile time (Runtime exceptions),
        and we can handle them.
        * NullPointerException
        * ArithmeticException
        * IllegalArgumentException
        * IndexOutOfBoundsException
        * IllegalStateException
     3. Errors : The exceptions which are not checked by compiler at compile time and we can't handle them.
        * StackOverflowError
        * OutOfMemoryError (infinitely recursion)


   - Exception Hierarchy
   -Object
     - Throwable
       - Error
       - Exception(checkedException)
            - RuntimeException(uncheckedException)


    - Exception Handling
     * sometimes the order of catch blocks is important. for example if we start with an IOException catch block
       and then follow it with a FileNotFoundException catch block, the FileNotFoundException catch block will never
       be reached, because a FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException and the upper casting is happened implicitly.
       so we need to start with more specific exception and then follow it with more general exception.

     * Defencive Programming: we mustn't handle all exceptions.
       -In some exception, we mustn't handle them because they must be corrected by programmer.for example if we have a
        NullPointerException it means that we have a bug in our code, and we must correct it. So we mustn't handle it.
        Instead we throw an exception.
      - Because using this approach can be noisy, we mustn't use it in all our methods and classes, instead we use it just
        when we get input from the user or from external sources. So at the boundary of our application.


     * Exceptions channing : it's about throwing a general exception and pass the specific exception as a cause
       in this way we can have a general exception of a class that throws all exceptions of this class.
