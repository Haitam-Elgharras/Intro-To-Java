Typical Usage:
    FileReader/BufferedReader for reading textual data from files.
    FileWriter/BufferedWriter for writing textual data to files.
    FileInputStream/BufferedInputStream for reading binary data.
    FileOutputStream/BufferedOutputStream for writing binary data.

    Remember, while using these classes, ensure proper exception handling, especially when dealing
    with file I/O operations as they can throw IOException. Additionally, it's good practice to close
    the streams after use to release system resources and preferred to use try-with-resources statement
