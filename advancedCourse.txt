### Exceptions ###
   - In java we have three types of exceptions
     1. Checked Exceptions : The exceptions which are checked by compiler at compile time.
     2. Unchecked Exceptions : The exceptions which are not checked by compiler at compile time (Runtime exceptions).
        * NullPointerException
        * ArithmeticException
        * IllegalArgumentException
        * IndexOutOfBoundsException
        * IllegalStateException
     3. Errors : The exceptions which are not checked by compiler at compile time and we can't handle them.
        * StackOverflowError
        * OutOfMemoryError (infinitely recursion)


   - Exception Hierarchy
   -Object
     - Throwable
       - Error
       - Exception(checkedException)
            - RuntimeException(uncheckedException)


    - Exception Handling
     * sometimes the order of catch blocks is important. for example if we start with an IOException catch block
       and then follow it with a FileNotFoundException catch block, the FileNotFoundException catch block will never
       be reached, because a FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException and the upper casting is happened implicitly.
       so we need to start with more specific exception and then follow it with more general exception.

     * Defencive Programming : we mustn't handle all exceptions.
       -in some exception we mustn't handle them cause they must be corrected by programmer.for example if we have a
        NullPointerException it means that we have a bug in our code, and we must correct it. so we mustn't handle it.
        instead we throw an exception.
      - Because using this approach can be noisy, we mustn't use it in all our methods and classes, instead we use it just
        when we get input from the user or from external sources. so at the boundary of our application.


     * Exceptions channing : it's about throwing a general exception and pass the specific exception as a cause
       in this way we can have a general exception of a class that throws all exceptions of this class.





### Generics ### : generics are used to create classes, interfaces and methods that take types as parameters.
   *Note1 : we can't instantiate T type directly inside our generic class, because we don't know what type it is.
        so we walk around this by : private T[] items = (T[]) new Object[10]; with that we perform:
        1. "Create an array of 10 memory spaces that can hold references to objects (initially set to null)."
        2. "I want to treat this array as if it's an array of type T, and I'll make sure that I only add elements of type T into it."
            This casting allows us to work with the array as if it's a generic array of type T, even though, under the hood, it's an
            array of Object references. It's a workaround to leverage arrays while dealing with Java's type erasure in generics.

   *Note2 : we can't use primitives as generic type parameters, because generics are implemented using type erasure.
            so we can't use int, double, char, boolean, float, long, short, byte, or any other primitive type as
            a generic type parameter. we can use only reference types. Instead, we can use the wrapper classes for
            these primitive types: Integer, Double, Character, Boolean, Float, Long, Short, Byte.

          - when working with Integer for example we have which we called boxing and unboxing:
            Integer myIntValue = 56; boxing : the compiler will convert this to Integer.valueOf(56);
            int myInt = myIntValue; // unboxing : the compiler will convert this to myIntValue.intValue();


### Constraints: we can use extends keyword to specify a type or an interface that the type must subclass of or
    implement the interface we choose. we can use multiple bounds by using & operator. and T will be a bound type.



### Generics under the hood:

1. **Type Erasure Basics**:
   - Generic types in Java provide type safety at compile-time. You can use placeholders like `T` to indicate that
     a class or method can work with different types.
   - However, at runtime, Java erases the generic type information. This means that the actual type parameter `T`
     is replaced with its upper bound or with `Object` if there's no bound. This process is known as type erasure.

2. **Erasure Replaces with Object**:
   - When Java performs type erasure, it essentially replaces generic type parameters like `T` with the `Object` class.
   - This is similar to non-generic code where you could store any object in a collection, but with generics, you gain
     compile-time type checking.

3. **Type Bounds and Constraints**:
   - If you specify type bounds or constraints on your generic type, Java's type erasure replaces `T` with the bound type.
   - For example, if you have a constraint like `<T extends Comparable<T>>`, then `T` will be replaced with `Comparable<T>`.
     This means that your generic class or method works with objects that implement the `Comparable` interface.

4. **Multiple Constraints**:
   - If you have multiple type constraints on your generic type, Java chooses the leftmost constraint for type erasure.
   - For instance, if you have `<T extends Serializable & Comparable<T>>`, `T` will be replaced with `Serializable`.

    So, Java's generic type erasure is a mechanism to provide type safety at compile time while preserving
    compatibility with older non-generic code at runtime. It replaces generic type parameters with their bounds or
    with `Object`, and when there are multiple bounds, it selects the leftmost one during type erasure.
